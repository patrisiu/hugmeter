    <h1>HugMeter Project Overview</h1>

    <p>HugMeter is a Flutter application designed to help users stay connected with their loved ones by facilitating expressions of affection through "hugs." It provides features for sharing location with trusted individuals, enabling users to be aware of their proximity to each other for potential meetups and to send virtual gestures of care.</p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul class="features">
        <li><strong>Location Sharing:</strong> Users have control over who they share their location with, allowing them to add or remove contacts from their sharing list.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Hugs:</strong> The app supports sending "virtual hugs" to contacts, offering a way to express affection regardless of geographical distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel Hug:</strong> This specific feature dynamically updates a user's location based on their distance to a chosen destination, providing more frequent updates as they get closer.</li>
        <li><strong>Group Management:</strong> Users can organize their contacts into various groups (e.g., friends, family, events) to manage sharing contexts efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Controls:</strong> HugMeter offers robust privacy settings, allowing users to define the frequency of location sharing (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly, daily, or only when the app is active). Users also have the option to remain completely hidden from others on the map.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy & Data Security:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The app emphasizes user privacy, ensuring that location sharing is unidirectional.</li>
        <li>Users can add or remove contacts for sharing silently, without notifying the other party.</li>
        <li>HugMeter does not collect personal identifying information such as names or email addresses.</li>
        <li>Location data is stored only for users who have explicitly enabled the location-sharing feature.</li>
        <li>Data is shared exclusively with users who have been granted explicit permission by the owner.</li>
        <li>An in-app account deletion feature is provided, empowering users to manage and remove their data at any time.</li>
    </ul>
