    <h1>HugMeter</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;">When was the last time you missed someone?</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;">Maybe you were walking down the street, or
        perhaps a piece of music made you think of them. In today’s world, we don’t always pick up the phone to call or
        even send a text, because the commitment to start a conversation might not feel right at the time.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;">But you still want to show them you care.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;">Why not send them a Hug? Regardless of the
        distance, regardless of the moment, HugMeter lets you bridge the gap. Whether they are across the street or
        across the globe, don't miss the chance to tell someone they are on your mind.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; color: #7986CB;">Share some love with a Virtual
        Hug and start spreading hearts around the world!</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>HugMeter started as a <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> project for learning purposes
        with the goal of staying connected with loved ones by expressing affection through hugs when people are nearby.
    </p>

    <p>Over time, the app has evolved to help you stay close to your loved ones, whether through Virtual Hugs sent
        across the world or alerts when a friend is nearby.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the collaboration of the <a href="../testers">Hug Testers</a>, new features are under development, but
        the main purpose of the app remains simple: to help people share love and let them know we care :)</p>

    <h2>How HugMeter Works</h2>
    <div class="features">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Virtual Hugs:</strong> Send a digital squeeze across the world instantly to let someone know
                they are on your mind.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Measure the Distance:</strong> See the physical distance between you and your next real-life
                hug.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity Alerts:</strong> Get notified when a "Hugger" in your circle is nearby and sharing
                their location.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custom Groups:</strong> Organize your friends and family into groups to control exactly who you
                share your location with.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more details, you can read the <a href="https://github.com/patrisiu/hugmeter">README from the
            repository</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-policy" id="privacy-policy">
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At HugMeter, we believe that sharing love shouldn't mean sacrificing your privacy. Our app is designed to be
            a "privacy-first" experience. We collect the bare minimum data required to send hugs and measure
            distance.</p>

        <h3>1. No Identity Tracking</h3>
        <p>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>
        <p>Your identity within the app is designed to keep you in control.</p>

        <h3>2. Your Location, Your Choice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not Real-Time:</strong> HugMeter is not a real-time tracking tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Frequency:</strong> You decide how often your approximate location is updated—choose
                between every hour, once per day, only when the app is open, or stay completely hidden.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity Only:</strong> Location data is used solely to notify you and your permitted "Huggers"
                when you are close enough for a real-life embrace.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Group-Based Sharing</h3>
        <p>You have total control over who sees your status. By organizing "Huggers" into different groups, you choose
            exactly which friends or family members can see your proximity and who cannot.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Security & Third Parties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Selling Data:</strong> Your information is never shared with, or sold to, third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Storage:</strong> We only store the last notified location for users with
                location-sharing enabled.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is handled securely to ensure that your connections remain private.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Right to Delete</h3>
        <p>You are in control of your data. You can manage your sharing settings or use the in-app Account Deletion
            feature to permanently remove your data at any time.</p>

        <h3>6. Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding your privacy, the use of your data, or the location-sharing
            feature, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:hugmeter@patrisiu.com">hugmeter@patrisiu.com</a>.
