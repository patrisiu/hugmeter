    <h1>HugMeter</h1>
    <!--<p>Measure distance to next Hug, notify when Hug is close, and share Virtual Hugs!</p>-->

    <p><em>When was the last time you missed someone? Maybe while walking down the street, or perhaps a piece of
        music made you think of them...</em></p>
    <p><em>Nowadays, we don’t always pick up the phone to call, or even send a text, because the commitment to start
        a conversation might not feel right at the time.</em></p>
    <p><em>But you still want to show them you care.</em></p>
    <p><em>Why not send them a Hug? Regardless of the distance, regardless of the moment! Share some love with a
        Virtual Hug!</em></p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>HugMeter started as a <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> project for learning purposes
        with the goal of staying connected with loved ones by expressing affection through hugs when people are nearby.
    </p>

    <p>Over time, the app has evolved to send alerts when a Hugger is sharing their location and is in close proximity.
        Additionally, Virtual Hugs can be sent across the world, regardless of the distance.</p>

    <p>This is not intended to be a real-time location tracking tool. People can choose to share their approximate
        location periodically —every hour, once per day, or only when using the app— or they can remain completely
        hidden.</p>

    <p>The application stores the last location notified for those Huggers with the feature enabled, so it may be
        outdated and not entirely reliable. In any case, this information is only used between users who have enabled
        this feature, and it is not shared with third parties. For more details, please refer to the <a
                href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> section.</p>

    <p>In addition, HugMeter allows you to organize your Huggers into different groups, giving you control over whom you
        share your location with and stay connected with loved ones in various ways.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the collaboration of the <a href="../testers">Hug Testers</a>, new features are under development, but
        the
        main purpose of the app is to help people share love through hugs and let them know we care :)</p>

    <p>The app also includes features to ensure user privacy and data security. It does not collect personal information
        like names or email addresses. Location data is only stored for users who enable the location-sharing feature
        and is only shared with explicitly permitted users. The app also offers an in-app account deletion feature for
        users to manage their data.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <div class="features">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance with the Hugs on the move!</strong> People decide who to share their location with
                and can freely join or leave your list.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Share your location with other Huggers:</strong> Add or remove trusted people to share your
                location and show them where you're ready to hug!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Spot all Hugs:</strong> Locate them on the map and navigate to your Hug with Google Maps.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Send Virtual Hugs:</strong> Let your Huggers know you want to hug them, no matter the
                distance!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Travel Hug: Stay Updated on the Go:</strong> Are you on your way to meet a Hugger or
                traveling to a distant destination? You can enable the Travel Hug feature to keep your location updated
                based on the distance. The closer you get, the more frequent the updates until you reach your
                destination!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Share your location periodically:</strong> At your discretion, you can share your location
                with your trusted Huggers every 15 minutes, hourly, once a day, when the app is open, or remain
                completely hidden!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Receive a notification when a Hug is approaching!</strong> Prepare for hugs based on distance
                and the latest activity updates.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Manage groups of Huggers:</strong> Stay connected and in control by organizing your Huggers
                into different groups. Whether you're enjoying a festival with friends, finding the perfect spot for
                beach volleyball, or sharing your global travel adventures with family, you can manage several Huggers
                Groups.
