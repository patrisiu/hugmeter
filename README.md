## About

This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project for learning purposes. The developed application offers a funny way to
share an approximated distance to a potential Hug.

This is not a real-time location tool. The User Location updates when the app is open. There are options to enable
periodical updates on the User Location. Location Permission and Autostart Permission should be configured on App
Settings to allow HugMeter run in the background. The Location Update frequency configured will be handled according to
the Operative System priorities.

In addition, the application offers an alert option that can be enabled to notify when a potential hug is approaching
for the last 25 minutes. The Location Update must be enabled for it. This feature does not work on the Web version.

As an extra, Virtual Hugs are available to send a loving reminder about our wish to Hug soon! This feature works with
the related Location File and only with people on the Huggers list. This feature subscription can be disabled on
Settings at any moment.

## Privacy Policy

HugMeter uses [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to store and share the User Location. For this
reason, a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/account/about/) with granted access to Google Drive is required. In
addition, access to Google Contacts can be granted to add other Huggers easier.

In any case the application access or stores personal data.

## Terms of Service

The HugMeter user has the ownership of the Location File(s) and decides with whom to share it. This is a one-direction
decision and no notification nor reciprocity request will be sent. There are no limits to silently share or remove
access to the Location File to other Google Accounts.
