## About

HugMeter started as a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project for learning purposes with the goal of staying connected
with loved ones by expressing affection through hugs when people are nearby.

Over time, the app has evolved to send alerts when a Hugger is sharing their location and is in close proximity.
Additionally, a Virtual Hug can be sent across the world, regardless of the distance.

This is not intended to be a real-time location tracking tool. People can choose to share their approximate location
periodically —every hour, once per day, or only when using the app— or they can remain completely hidden.

The application stores the last location notified for those Huggers with the feature enabled, so it may be outdated and
not entirely reliable. In any case, this information is only used between users who have enabled this feature, and it is
not shared with third parties. For more details, please refer to the Privacy Policy section.

Furthermore, the sharing feature is unidirectional, meaning that individuals can choose whom to share their location
with without expecting a reciprocal sharing response. Users can silently add and remove Huggers without warning to
preserve their privacy.

Thanks to the collaboration of the Hug Testers, new features are under development, but the main purpose of the app is
to help people share love through hugs and let them know we care.

## Privacy Policy

HugMeter uses [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to store and share the User Location. For this
reason, a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/account/about/) with granted access to Google Drive is required. In
addition, access to Google Contacts can be granted to add other Huggers easier.

In any case the application access or stores personal data.

## Terms of Service

The HugMeter user has the ownership of the Location File(s) and decides with whom to share it. This is a one-direction
decision and no notification nor reciprocity request will be sent. There are no limits to silently share or remove
access to the Location File to other Google Accounts.
