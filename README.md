## About

HugMeter started as a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) project for learning purposes with the goal of staying connected
with loved ones by expressing affection through hugs when people are nearby.

Over time, the app has evolved to send alerts when a Hugger is sharing their location and is in close proximity.
Additionally, [Virtual Hugs](#purpleheart-send-virtual-hugs) can be sent across the world, regardless of the distance.

This is not intended to be a real-time location tracking tool. People can choose to share their approximate location
periodically —every hour, once per day, or only when using the app— or they can remain completely hidden.

The application stores the last location notified for those Huggers with the feature enabled, so it may be outdated and
not entirely reliable. In any case, this information is only used between users who have enabled this feature, and it is
not shared with third parties. For more details, please refer to the [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) section.

Furthermore, the sharing feature is unidirectional, meaning that individuals can choose whom to share their location
with without expecting a reciprocal sharing response. Users can silently add and remove Huggers without warning to
preserve their privacy.

Thanks to the collaboration of the Hug Testers, new features are under development, but the main purpose of the app is
to help people share love through hugs and let them know we care.
